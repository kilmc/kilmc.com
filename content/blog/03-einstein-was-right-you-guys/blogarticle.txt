Summary: Time seems to be slipping away from me recently and I think I know why.

Text: The actual passing of time versus my experience it is such an interesting thing to me. I'm quite a punctual person and the moments leading to me getting somewhere on time run away from me at speed, yet when I've arrived everything immediately slows down as I wait for the other person to turn up.

From a physics perspective, time being relative makes *some* sense to me. An object with more mass stretches space-time more, and when you're close to this object, you are effected by the stretching. 

What I find fascinating is that your brain operates on a very similar level. If you take responsibility as your object in this metaphor you can see a parity. Let's say you are a child. There is literally nothing you *have* to do. You can do your homework, you can get help with it, you can sleep, you can act out, you can do whatever. But there's nothing you *have* to do. Now consider a parent. You are looking into a black hole of responsibility. The mass is infinite. Parenting, like many other things in life, is a bottomless pit of things to do.

Admittedly other factors affect your experience of time but I think the sense that time is slipping away from you can be strongly attributed to a mass of responsibility. The take-away from this thought is that can have an effect on this. If you are stressed out. If the weeks aren't long enough, find a way to shed something. Take a weekend and finish a project that's just constantly on your mind. Ask for help. Whatever you can do to keep that object manageable. Don't let it weigh you down.

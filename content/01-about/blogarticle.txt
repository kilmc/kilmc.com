Text: My name is Kilian McMahon. I'm a graphic and web design for the most part. This site is the beginning of something much bigger and more interesting. It will hopefully become a nice journal of my work and my life. Something that can be informative and also help me remember all the things that happen to me. 

I hope you enjoy the site and the content that I'll be putting out in the future.

Thanks to (twitter: miekd text: Maykel Loomans) for the wonderful title image there. It makes me laugh on a regular basis, and when I miss (twitter: kylemeyer text: Kyle Meyer) it cheers me up.

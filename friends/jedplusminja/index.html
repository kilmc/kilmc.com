    <h1>Hi Jed and Minja!</h1>
    <p>
      You are wonderful humans. Ko is very lucky to have the two of you as parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      New York has also been lucky to have both of you here, filling the community with delicious bread and other wonderful food, the clearest ice and the quickest puns.
    </p>
    <p>
      But your move doesn't mean you won't come back for a visit right? With that in mind, I wanted to askâ€¦

      I wanted to see if we can finally beat your curse of never being able to see Kishi Bashi. He's playing Webster Hall and I got the three of us (oops, I invited myself) tickets to see him.

      Hopefully this works out, but if for whatever reason you're out of the country or have plans already, that is tooootally cool.
    </p>
    <p>I love you both. Best of luck with the move and the new Upstate life!</p>

        I have been travelling around North America f<i>*</i>or a little over three months.<i>*</i> To say it has been fun is an understatement. My experiences during this time have genuinely changed my perspective on the world and how I can have an effect on it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Throughout this trip I have met some truly incredible people. I have regularly been complimented by a lot of them for my energy, my positivity and my enthusiasm. I am humbled by this anytime anyone says it to me. I have also been overcome when—every now and then—people would tell me I should move to their cities, that I <a href="#">should</a> work with them, work for them or find a way to stay longer. This above anything else has been my biggest struggle during my journey. Here's why.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the time I have spent in North America I have seen a strong community with a feverish desire to create, to make great things and with an intent to have a positive impact on things more important than their bank balance. When you bring like-minded, hard-working, driven people together; it creates an addicting atmosphere, one that is hard to leave once you are involved. However, I feel that it is my job—not to become another member of an established group but—to be part of a driving force behind encouraging this same atmosphere in Ireland. I feel strongly that I can have an effect in my country. I want to make Ireland a place where creators feel empowered, a place where we understand our value goes beyond making apps, designing logo's and building products. I want to foster the mentality that we as creators can actively and positively change the world around us. What if the next big thing was not another Facebook but a new way to approach teaching, or healthcare, the law even.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This may seem idealistic but honestly, I feel that it is simply a case of broadening our perspective. We need to see beyond the trivial and set our sites on bigger, more challenging problems—the rewards of solving which are beyond measure.
